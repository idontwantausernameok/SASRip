<h1>@ViewData["Title"]</h1>

<p>SASRip has a free API you can use to download files however you want.</p>
<p>Only restriction is that you may not use it commercially.</p>
<p>All personal use is fair game.</p>
<br />
<p>SASRip is using youtube-dl as it's back-bone.</p>
<p>So the API supports all download services that youtube-dl supports.</p>

<p>The you can make an API call over at:</p>
/api/DownloadAPI/mp4/
<br />
or
<br />
/api/DownloadAPI/mp3/
<br />
<p>Your GET request must contain a header with "download_url" as key and the link to the video/audio as the value.</p>
<p>You will then have to await a JSON response, containing the following Key-Value Pairs:</p>
Success - Boolean, if the video/audio extraction was successful. <br />
MimeType - String, either "video/mp4" or "audio/mpeg". <br />
DownloadPath - String, the URL to your file, use if Success is true. <br />
<br />
<h2>Important Notice:</h2>
Please keep in mind that the conversion process can take several minutes, as converting some file types (such as MKV) to MP4 can take a while.
